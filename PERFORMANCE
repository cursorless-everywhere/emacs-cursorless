places I'm spending time:

- svg-image
- calculating # of columns in line? (tried to optimize, CHECK)
- updating all lines instead of just on-screen ones
- creating & destroying overlays (HOW MUCH?)

to achieve better perf:

- cache & reuse an empty-line svg
- avoid recalculating stuff by repeated calls to cursorless-line-svg
- use individual hat images & reuse/avoid duplicates
  to avoid hitting svg-image
- reuse overlays on each line, only create/destroy as needed
