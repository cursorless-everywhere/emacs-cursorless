- maybe make "fake lines" above real lines
  and then put characters on them in a custom face
  to imitate hats

  if we can adjust the height we could make it only as tall
  as it needs to be

- or, svg-of-character
  but alignment and styling are hard then

- or, hack emacs C code to allow overlaying svgs on characters
  not clear how practical this is.
