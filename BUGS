- Synchronization of selection not quite right.
- Can't use line numbers.
- next-line sometimes incorrectly goes to start of line.
- "cursorless cheatsheet" doesn't work (need to update cursorless?)

- Hats in wrong positions after insertions or deletions;
  this can leave hats hanging after large deletions, for example.

- Synchronization doesn't work for terminal or comint buffers because it triggers
  post-command and subprocesses can update the buffer in the background.

- Doesn't work in many non-file buffers, because it tries to update the entire
  buffer at once instead of applying a small diff.
  eg: ansi-term

- Wrong hat positions in dired mode, I think because some text is hidden and
  it gets sent to cursorless anyways.
