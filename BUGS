- Only displays hats in one chosen buffer.
  We could at least display hats for whichever buffer you are in.
  Eventually we should display hats for all buffers.
- Synchronization of selection not quite right.
- Can't use line numbers.
- next-line sometimes incorrectly goes to start of line.
- "cursorless cheatsheet" doesn't work (need to update cursorless?)
- No support for hat shapes.

- Hats in wrong positions after insertions or deletions;
  this can leave hats hanging after large deletions, for example.

- Synchronization doesn't work for terminal or comint buffers because it only
  triggers post-command and subprocesses can update the buffer in the background.

- Doesn't work in buffers with read-only text, because it tries to update the
  entire buffer at once instead of applying a small diff. eg: ansi-term, dired,
  buffer list

  Could at least allow cursor to move if there's no change to file contents!

- Wrong hat positions in dired mode, I think because some text is hidden and
  it gets sent to cursorless anyways.
